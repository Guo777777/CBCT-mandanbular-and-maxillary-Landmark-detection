# Landmark-detection

This repository contains the codebase for our deep learning model developed for automatic landmark detection on CBCT images to measure basal bone width. The method was proposed and validated in our paper *"Cone-beam CT landmark detection for measuring basal bone width: a retrospective validation study"*, which has been accepted by **BMC Oral Health**.

The model utilizes a two-stage coarse-to-fine U-Net framework trained on 3D CBCT data to identify anatomical landmarks critical for assessing maxillary and mandibular transverse dimensions. Once the paper is published online, the code will be made publicly available to support reproducibility and further research.
